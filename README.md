My name is Jamie Doman, I am currently studying towards a Bachelor of Commerce in Information Systems. I am learning how to code and develop apps. I am 22 years old. I hope to do a matsers combining the computer science and law fields either in Asia, Europe or The United States. I enjoy listening to hip/hop/rap/R&B/neo-soul music, playing soccer, cooking and swimming/surfing.
